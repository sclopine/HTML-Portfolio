<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sarah who lives in Texas. I deciced to learn how to be a web designer and love every moment of that. I wanted to be a web designer for a while now, but did not know where to start. Now that you can find anything and everything online and not pay thousands of dollars to a college for a degree, I thought now would be the best time to pick up a coding language and Full Stack Web Developer is what I wanted to go with.</p>

<p>When I am not learning to code, you can find me playing a game on the computer whether that is Stardew Valley or any other game that as caught my attention. (Thank you ADHD). If I am not at the computer you can find me hanging out with my husband and two cat in the bed watching TV. While watching TV I will either have a crochet hook in hand and a pattern on my tablet or I am knitting something.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my about me section, and looking over this site I made up while doing a bootcamp. If you have any questions, please reach out and let me help your with your next website.</p>
